            About Me
          </h2>
  
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in backend and data systems,
           and I'm focused on building reliable, end-to-end solutions that serve real users. 
            I enjoy owning the full lifecycle — from designing APIs and data flows to crafting clean, usable interfaces.


          </p>
  
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I've led production-grade ETL pipelines, initiated AI and automation efforts at a bank,
           and recently built a full-stack sports scheduler using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.
          </p>
  
          <p className="text-base md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My toolkit includes Python, SQL, Azure, TypeScript, Node.js, and React. I'm driven by clarity,
           performance, and a deep belief in building systems that deliver real value — not just to companies,
            but to the people who use them.
          </p>
